  Our research is also focused on the development of accelerated acquisition, undersampled reconstruction and motion correction techniques for free-breathing cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. We are particularly interested in the application of these methods to 3D whole-heart coronary MRI and quantitative first-pass myocardial perfusion and their translation into clinical practice.
